Hello aliens!

Earth is a little crazy right now with global warming, racism, the slave trade, etc. So I don't think now is a good time. But how did you guys even find Earth or travel to Earth. To travel all those light years must be extremely expensive. Also, how much more advanced is your civilization? Compared to other exoplanets, Earth is extremely young. Anyways, maybe you guys can help us out.

Peace out.
